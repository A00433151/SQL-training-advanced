# S09-P01 Practice

## Assignment

To make sure you really understand how to write a procedure with a cursor,
please rewrite procedure from `S09-L02` and:

* change cursor name from `cursor_users` to `all_users_cursor`
* change parameter `no_more_rows` to `v_finished TINYINT`
* change the loop's name from `loop_users` to `user_loop`

In addition, after the procedure finishes inserting user stats, return the
count of users which were affected.
